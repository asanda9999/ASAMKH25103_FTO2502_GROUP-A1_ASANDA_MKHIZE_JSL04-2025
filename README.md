# JSL04 Project Brief: Dynamic Task Display & Modal View

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a **dynamic Kanban-style task board** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Tasks are loaded from a predefined dataset and rendered into three columns — **To Do**, **In Progress**, and **Done** — based on their status.

Each task is **clickable** and opens a **modal view** where the task's title, description, and status can be **viewed, edited, or deleted**. This feature demonstrates practical usage of **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **modular JS structure**, with a fully **responsive and accessible UI** that follows the design provided in Figma.
